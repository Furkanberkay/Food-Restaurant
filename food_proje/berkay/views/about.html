          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Paylastikca was founded in 1964, when it was not even known whether it existed yet;
            It started its service in a warm environment and with unique flavors that make a difference.
            During the time of the Marmaris Büfe opened by brothers Nihat and Mehmet Sargın on Taksim Cumhuriyet Street;
            It has regulars from many different profiles, from theater to politics, from cinema to business change.
            Not only famous celebrities but also people from all walks of life rushed to Marmaris Büfe to meet the taste
            they were looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interest and devotion shown to Marmaris Buffet delicacies increased so much over time; Many buffets opened
            began to use the "Marmaris" brand. It's nice to be imitated; However, since this name only belongs to the original
            Paylastikca on Taksim Cumhuriyet Street, necessary initiatives were taken and the “real” taste was protected.
